# vue-intro

This is an example of a very simple [Vue.js](http://github.com/vuejs/vue) application generated with [Vue.js CLI](http://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli) which uses the Meetup API to show the concept of components, routes and requests using Vue.js, I've created it to do a lecture about it on [Grupy-SP](https://www.meetup.com/Grupy-SP/events/254342503/).

This is the exactly code written during the talk.
